# jSS7

jSS7 is an open-source Java implementation of an **SS7 signaling stack**, enabling Java applications to communicate with legacy SS7 network elements and SIGTRAN-based infrastructures.

The project provides protocol-level support for both traditional SS7 deployments and IP-based signaling, and is designed to be embedded as a core signaling component within telecom platforms.

This repository is maintained and published as open source by **PAiCore Technology**.

## Supported Protocols

jSS7 is the only Open Source Java based implementation of the SS7 protocol stack. It provides implementations for the protocols of the SS7/SIGTRAN stack:

- MTP2
- MTP3
- ISUP
- M3UA (SIGTRAN over IP)
- SCCP
- TCAP
- MAP
- CAP
- INAP

The stack supports integration with IP-based SS7 signaling environments (SIGTRAN), and can be used with Intel family signaling boards (Dialogic SS7 cards) or Zaptel/Dahdi compatible TDM devices (Digium, Sangoma).
